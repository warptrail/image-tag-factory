# The Image Tag Factory


### Overview

The ITF takes in 6 inputs.

* The image source (minus its file extension).
    src="img/photo"
* The file extension of the image source (is tagged onto the end of the iteration number). Enter it with or without the "." at the begining.
    src="img/photo-7.png"
* The anchor href (optional) will create a link out of the image.
    <a href="/"><img src="img/photo-7.png"></a>
* The image alt description. Best practice to add a desciption of each image. Will be identical excpet for iteration number tagged at the end.
* The image class (optional).
* iterate to the number inputed to create x amount of unique image elements. Too many iterations will overwork your machine, so it is maxed out at 999. 

When the desired inputs are entered, click submit. Just remember when entering the src not to put in the file extension. The html code for your images will be generated below. Copy and paste them into your project. Make sure your local image files are all named to the same extenstion.
